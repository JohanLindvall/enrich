# CLAUDE.md — enrich

Log-line metadata extraction: timestamp, normalized severity, trace/span IDs,
structured-log fields, Azure resource metadata, exception details. Entry
points: `Parse(string) *Result` (allocates the Result), `ParseInto(string,
*Result) bool` and `ParseBytes([]byte, *Result) bool` (caller-owned Result;
allocation-free).

## Layout

- `doc.go` — package documentation.
- `enrich.go` — `Parse` itself and the `Result` result type. Dispatch
  order: generated JSON decode → logfmt scan (`enrichFromLogFmt`) → regex
  pattern table (`enrichFromPatterns`). First strategy that applies wins;
  `Result.Format` records which one did.
- `fields.go` — the `enrichFields` struct listing the JSON keys `Parse`
  inspects, with lightning tag options (`a|b|c` key aliases, `nocopy`, `lax`).
- `fields_unmarshal.go` — **GENERATED** from `fields.go` by the lightning
  generator. Never edit by hand; edit `fields.go` and run `make generate`.
  CI fails if it is stale.
- `lineparser.go` — the regex pattern table for plain-text formats (nginx,
  Apache, klog, redis, syslog, Lambda, Spring Boot, tracebacks, ...) plus
  timestamp-layout parsing. `firstBytes` derives a first-byte prefilter from
  each pattern's anchored prefix — a new anchored shape needs a classifier
  case or it silently loses the cheap skip (the miss path is ~9x slower
  without it). Unanchored entries must carry a `contain` prefilter.
- `severity.go` — severity normalization, numeric levels, HTTP/gRPC/syslog/
  redis code-to-severity mapping. `severityLUT` **is** the normalizer, not a
  cache in front of one: the set of level spellings is finite, so every input
  is decided in O(1) (an unknown word used to cost ~330 ns walking 8 regexes;
  it now costs ~12 ns). The regexes live on in `severity_test.go` as an
  oracle, and a 500k-input randomized differential test pins the table to
  them — extend the table and that test together.
- `testdata/fuzz/FuzzParse/` — the corpus the fuzzer accumulated. `go test`
  replays every entry as a seed, so it is a regression suite; add to it by
  running the fuzzer and copying new finds out of `$(go env GOCACHE)/fuzz`.

## Invariants and gotchas

- **Results alias the input.** `Body` is the input string; JSON-populated
  string fields alias the input's backing array via `nocopy`/`unsafe.Slice`.
  Never mutate the byte views; anything returned to callers must be a string
  aliasing the immutable input or a copy.
- **JSON field order matters** in `enrichFromJSON`: nested `properties.log`
  is enriched first so authoritative top-level scalars (notably the Azure
  "time") win over lifted values. `level` is listed last in the Severity tag
  so a later textual value wins; capital `"Level"` is deliberately excluded
  (Serilog uses it for a message property, not severity).
- **`enrichFromLogFmt` runs before the pattern table** and also handles the
  level-only case; the table's logfmt-ish entries only see lines without
  `=` pairs. It scans the whole line (no early exit) so trace_id/span_id/
  traceparent keys are found wherever they appear.
- **klog timestamps carry no year** — `expandKlogTime` infers it and adjusts
  across year boundaries; the corresponding test skips the year.
- **Envoy `response_code: 0`**: no `protocol` field → TCP proxying, info;
  `response_flags` DR/DC → client disconnect, warn.
- **Pino numeric levels** are handled by a raw-line scan (`pinoSeverity`),
  not the decoder: the "level" key must stay on the string Severity field
  (textual levels are far more common) and lightning rejects a key mapped to
  two fields.
- **Severity numbers can be finer-grained than the text**: the OTLP numbers
  give each level a range of four (`InfoLevelNo`..`Info4LevelNo`), so syslog
  notice is info with SeverityNumber Info2 (10). Parse's final normalization
  keeps a pre-set number, so don't reset SeverityNumber after applySubmatch.
- **Don't add a dynamic severity cache.** It cannot beat the LUT's ~20 ns on
  hits, it would need locking (the package has no mutable state today), and it
  would be keyed by attacker-influenced log content — an unbounded map that a
  flood of junk level tokens grows without limit.
- **The package never logs.** A library writing to the global slog is
  unconfigurable by its callers; an unparseable line is reported through
  `Result.Format` and a zero `Result.Time` instead. Don't reintroduce it.
- **`ParseInto` must fully reset the Result** (`*result = Result{Body: input}`)
  — callers reuse one across lines, so any field left behind leaks into the
  next line. Guarded by TestParseInto_ResetsResult.
- **Test data is anonymized.** Log lines in tests use example.com/acme/base
  names, TEST-NET IPs (203.0.113.x), and all-zero dummy GUIDs. Keep it that
  way: never paste raw production log lines into tests — scrub domains,
  emails, GUIDs, tokens, public IPs, and user identifiers first.

## Commands

```sh
make            # fix (generate+gofmt+tidy) + lint + test
make test       # go test -cover ./...
make lint       # golangci-lint (config: .golangci.yml)
make bench      # benchmarks
make generate   # regenerate fields_unmarshal.go
go test -run='^$' -fuzz=FuzzParse -fuzztime=30s .   # fuzz Parse after parser changes
```

Local note: this machine has cgo disabled, so `-race` doesn't run here; CI
runs the race detector on amd64 and arm64.

## Lint

`.golangci.yml` excludes staticcheck SA5008 for `fields.go` only — it flags
lightning's `nocopy`/`lax` tag options as unknown. Don't widen the exclusion.

## Performance

`Parse` is on a hot path (one call per log line). Current numbers
(Ryzen 7 8840HS, amd64), with the result escaping as it does for a real
caller: ~480 ns / 1 alloc for a ~900 B JSON line, ~760 ns / 1 alloc for a
~1.9 kB logfmt line, ~865 ns / 2 allocs for a pattern-table line, ~320 ns /
1 alloc for a 1 kB line that matches nothing. **That single alloc is the
320 B `Result` itself** — `ParseInto` with a reused `Result` is fully
zero-allocation (~370 ns), and is what a per-line pipeline should call.

The parsing work itself allocates nothing on the JSON and logfmt paths:

- **Never add a `*int64` (or other pointer) field to `enrichFields`.** The
  generated decoder heap-allocates the pointee, once per line per field. Use
  `json.Number` with `nocopy` instead: it aliases the input, and an empty
  value means the key was absent — which is the only reason the pointers
  existed. See `jsonInt`.
- **Never `string(val)` inside the logfmt callback.** The bytes alias the
  input and the input is immutable, so `unsafe.String` is free; a conversion
  copies the value on every line.
- The pattern path's one remaining alloc is the `[]int` that
  `FindStringSubmatchIndex` returns; its size scales with the capture-group
  count, which is why `nonCapturing` rewrites every unnamed group to `(?:`.
  Keep new table entries free of unnamed capturing groups.
- Trace/span IDs are validated by hand (`validTraceID`/`validSpanID`), not by
  regex — the old regexes cost ~40% of the JSON path on a line carrying a
  request_id.

The pattern table is ordered roughly most-common-first; every entry needs
either a `firstBytes` classifier match or a `contain` substring pre-filter
(see the lineparser.go note above) — the miss path regressed 9x without them.
